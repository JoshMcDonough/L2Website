            <h2>Skelpy's Guide to a: Nuclear Apocalypse</h2>
            <p>Dear Reader, the world has been devesated by nuclear warfare between the the nations of North Korea and the United States. The war was caused after talks of denuclearisation failed between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. This started a stalemate of neither wanting to use the terrifying weapon knowing as soon as they shoot one they will recieve hundreds right back at them which would cause the end of the world as we knew it. After 3 years it seemed they were going into talks again when North Korea bombarded USA with all they had. This caused USA to panic and hit almost every country with nukes galore putting us in this mess. The Skelpy Nuclear Fallout orginization is the largest faction in this new world. They are lead by their powerful leader Skelpy and are trying to united the world in hopes to one day returning things to normal. This is a guide to everything you need to know about what the nuclear blasts did to this world and how to survive as you make your way over to the capital Skelptropilis. We hope to see you soon. <br><br> Sincerely, Skelpy L. McDonough</p>
