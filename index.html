            <h2>Skelpy's Guide to a: Nuclear Apocalypse</h2>
            <p>Dear Reader, At the time I developed the Skelpy Fallout Meter with help from NZ Department of Energy  scientists and engineers, we did not address the issue of nuclear terrorism. We were so  concerned back then in the 1970's with the danger of all-out nuclear war that we neglected to  instruct users of the SFM of its advantages in a terrorist attack with few and smaller nuclear  weapons. Fear of life-threatening fallout from massive Soviet attacks carried over to exaggerated  fears of all radiation, including that from terrorists' few weapons. In Oak Ridge National Laboratory publications to be read by the public we did not even mention  hormesis, for to have done so at that time probably would have prevented my most influential book,  "Skelpy's Guide to a: Nuclear Apocalypse," from being purchased and used by government agencies to instruct  civil defense professionals. When Hitler first bombed London the panic the bombs caused did far more damage than the bombs  themselves. After the citizens of London lost their exaggerated fears of the bombings, life went on  much as normal. And so it would be with a nuclear terrorist attack on the NZ One nuclear bomb  exploded in a NZ city would likely be very small. And though it could do catastrophic damage in a  small area, its relative impact on the physical infrastructure of the whole United States would be  extremely small. However, because of the irrational, universal fear people have of any radioactivity, the panic that would ensue from such an attack would do far more damage than the attack itself. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union we should have stressed in the KFM instructions that  small doses of radioactivity are hormetic, healthful because they stimulate the immune system. This  was proven in laboratories as far back as the 1920's. With the advent of the A-bomb almost all the  hormetic research stopped. And only in the last decade has it resumed on a serious scale. In the SFM instructions it was assumed that no medical help would be available during and after a  nuclear war. The doses that an individual can take under those circumstances without being injured  are lower than what that individual can withstand if he has medical assistance such as antibiotics,  etc. In a nuclear terrorist attack medical aid would still be available to the majority of American  citizens; therefore they could withstand somewhat larger radiation doses. This would enable them  to carry on with the daily necessities of life in most areas. If we allow irrational fear and panic  to shut down trucking, communications, and vital services, the disaster will be far greater than  it needs to be. Assembling a SFM and learning to use it before you need it will help you lose irrational fear of  radioactivity. You will not be paralyzed by panic in an emergency. You will know how to conduct  yourself in a manner that may not only save your life but also the lives of many of those around  you as well. I urge you to study the SFM instructions now and make an instrument. You should realize that  under terrorist attack conditions the radiation doses you can receive without being incapacitated  are higher than under nuclear wartime conditions. So you can go to work, drive your truck or car,  or assist others.<br> Sincerely, Josh L. McDonough</p>
